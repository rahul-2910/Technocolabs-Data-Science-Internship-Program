## Mini Project 2
### Prediction of credit card defaults
We had a sample of 30,000 people in which we had to perform Exploratory Data Analysis, apply machine learning algorithms to find whether the account will be default next month or not.

## Final Project
### ASL Recognition with Deep Learning
American Sign Language (ASL) is the primary language used by many deaf individuals in North America, and it is also used by hard-of-hearing and hearing individuals. The language is as rich as spoken languages and employs signs made with the hand, along with facial gestures and bodily postures.
In this project, we trained a convolutional neural network to classify images of ASL letters.
